# birbMask

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was Masks.

- Knew I wanted to make something AR based.
- Did not know how to make something AR based.
- I've dabbled before but found that the ML packages I'd tried struggled a bit with real time.
- Turned out not a lot has changed.
- Tried a couple of packages with laggy, fan panicking results.

Settled on [Jeeliz](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter).
- It promised to be fast, easy to setup & readily compatible with Three.
- I spent along time disputing this.
- TBF a lot of my issues were to do with webpack integration.
- Never sure if webpack helps or hinders me more.

Got it working in the end!
- Decided to make masks with half a sphere and a shader material.
- Gonna pretend that these shaders are aesthetic choices.
- Definitely not rapid prototypes that I warmed to and kept.

Side note.
- One of the topics that was almost picked this week was "Ducks with no legs."
- While the voting was going on I knocked out a very quick duck with tentacles in Blender.
- Tentaduck is included here for absolutely no reason other than I had him.


Now because I had made somewhat shoddy masks styling it well would've looked silly.
-That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
- I will use the metal font at any opportunity.

- Used this badly for my background, you should have a look though, can definitely be used well.
